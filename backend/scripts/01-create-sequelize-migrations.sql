-- This file is now replaced by Sequelize migrations
-- Run the following commands to create and run migrations:

-- npx sequelize-cli init
-- npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create-initial-tables
-- npx sequelize-cli db:migrate

-- The actual table creation is now handled by Sequelize models
-- This ensures better consistency between code and database schema

SELECT 'Sequelize migrations should be used instead of raw SQL' as message;
